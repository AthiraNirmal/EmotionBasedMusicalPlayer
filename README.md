# EmotionBasedMusicalPlayer
A musical player that plays the songs according to the emotion(Happy/Sad) of the user

The key objectives of this project can be split into two parts, the recognition of the emotion of
the user and music analysis. The project is centred and focused more towards different
approaches to emotion recognition and the impact of each technique used. The emotion
recognition stage is heavily based on image processing and machine learning. The music
analysis is done by reading the MP3 metadata of a music file.

1. Emotion Recognition:
The key aim of this section is to implement and analyse various techniques to extract features
and classify the emotion of a person. The image processing step requires turning the image to
grayscale and resizing it. This is followed by extracting multiple features using different
techniques and adapting different classifiers to determine the mood of the user. Using these
different methods and techniques, an analysis is made to determine the best solution for the
emotion recognition problem based on my project.

2. Music Extractions
As per the input, which is the mood of the user, application selects the song from the
respective playlist (happy/sad)
